AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

### What did I Learn üè´

Probably the most important aspect of this project was learning how to use the principles of OOP(object orientated programming). Specifically how to use classes correctly.

Other things I learned:

- Furthered my knowledge of inquirer

- Learned more about how to structure my applications
